# RAG Turnkey

This standalone application repository consumes released TPF compiler, runtime, connector, and Block artifacts.

This reference topology is two independently deployable TPF applications. The queue-async INDEXER admits documents and runs `DocumentFile → packaged deterministic text extraction → ONE_TO_MANY chunks → embedding Query → vector upsert Command → MANY_TO_ONE IndexReceipt`. The synchronous REST QUERY application runs `Question → embedding Query → vector search Query → RetrievedContext → LLM Query → citation validation → Answer`.

They share only external infrastructure: one Ollama service supplies embeddings to both applications and answer generation to QUERY, while PostgreSQL supplies the durable pgvector tables. They have separate roots, processes, datasource pools, connector instances, capture/effect stores, retries, scaling, releases, failure domains, admission mechanisms, and latency objectives. Querying is not the next stage of one indexing execution, so checkpoint handoff is inappropriate.

Start infrastructure with `scripts/infrastructure.sh up -d`, pull models with `scripts/pull-models.sh`, and run `scripts/run-indexer.sh` and `scripts/run-query.sh` in separate terminals. Admit one or more `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` files with `scripts/ingest.sh path/to/document.pdf` or normal shell expansion such as `scripts/ingest.sh path/to/*.docx`; ask with `scripts/ask.sh 'your question'`. PostgreSQL listens on 5433 and Ollama on 11435 to avoid common local defaults. INDEXER uses HTTP/gRPC ports 8080/9000; QUERY uses 8081/9001. Override them with `INDEXER_HTTP_PORT`, `INDEXER_GRPC_PORT`, `QUERY_HTTP_PORT`, and `QUERY_GRPC_PORT`.

On Windows, `mvnw.cmd` does not derive a non-default Docker CLI context. Set `DOCKER_HOST` and, for TLS endpoints, `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` before running container-backed Maven tests.

The INDEXER depends on the reusable `org.pipelineframework.blocks:document-text-extraction` artifact and invokes its `document-text-extraction` definition through ordinary `pipeline:` composition. The application owns no extraction service, format routing, materialized document type, or PDF/DOCX libraries. The package chooses a format from the declared content type and original file extension, then extracts text deterministically. Plain text and Markdown are decoded as strict UTF-8, PDF uses PDFBox, and DOCX uses a narrow Apache POI body parser for paragraphs and tables. Each input is limited to 10 MiB and extracted text to 10,485,760 characters. A declared oversized payload is rejected before materialization, and either limit produces TPF's existing non-retryable failure so queue-async execution does not repeat deterministic limit failures. The typed `ExtractedDocument` carries diagnostics for the selected format, whether content type or extension selected it, input bytes, extracted characters, and any selection note. Markdown markup is retained as text.

This deterministic block does not perform OCR or vision recovery. Image-only PDFs and scanned pages therefore fail as having no extractable text. If an application needs probabilistic recovery, it should compose that capability as an external `Query` after deterministic extraction proves insufficient; it should not hide model I/O inside the block.

QUERY allows two minutes per local Ollama request because loading the answer model after the embedding model can be slow on a constrained workstation. Override this with `OLLAMA_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`; the ask script bounds connection establishment but deliberately does not impose a total response deadline.

`EmbeddingProviderConfiguration.model` and dimensions are binding-owned because they define vector meaning. Ollama endpoints/timeouts and PostgreSQL connection/schema/table/pool settings are deployment configuration. The Ollama LLM adapter still accepts its established binding-level `baseUrl` for compatibility; when omitted, as in QUERY, it uses the runtime-owned `pipeline.llm.langchain4j.ollama.base-url`. Both Ollama adapters use `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in this example.

Chunk IDs encode immutable source provenance, index, and content hash. The model authors only answer text and cited chunk IDs. The final validator rejects unknown, duplicate, or missing citations and copies source IDs/excerpts only from retrieved typed context.

The sibling `rag-composition-proof` remains the deterministic, network-free CI fixture. Its shared in-memory binding is a proof convenience, not the recommended deployment topology.
